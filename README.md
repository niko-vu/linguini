# Linguini

## Description

Linguini is a revolutionary language studying application designed to empower users to take on new languages by providing them with a place, much like a digital notetaker, to frequent and store their translations.  With its comprehensive and accessible interface, Linguini aims to give those who enjoy learning on their own, an opportunity to familiarize themselves with their personal diction in another language. Linguini opens doors to communication and cultural understanding.
