# Linguini

## Description

Linguini is a revolutionary language studying application designed to empower users to take on new languages by providing them with a place, much like a digital notetaker, to frequent and store their translations.  With its comprehensive and accessible interface, Linguini aims to give those who enjoy learning on their own, an opportunity to familiarize themselves with their personal diction in another language. Linguini opens doors to communication and cultural understanding.

The motivation for creating a project like Linguini came from acknowledging the existence of the many apps out there that teach languages and also acknowledging the lack of apps out there that aid rather than teach. We wanted to build something that could serve as an accommodation for people who enjoy self-studying and those who can only learn on their own due to a lack of opportunity, resources, etc.

## Usage
